Thank you for taking the time to visit my page.

My name is TofuSupreme! (Or my alias online). I am a 7 years American expat in Japan. Throughout my time in Japan, I've been an English Teacher (ALT). It was not my intention when I've arrived. Originally with the hopes of becoming a translator, I came to Japan to study Japanese intensively. Unfortunately, the route of becoming a translator was not aligned with who I am. In 2020 (during the CoVid pandemic in Japan) and a growing distain for teaching, I've discovered coding. Since then, with the help of my mentor, I've been on a self-taught route in becoming a front-end developer. This year, however, I realize that I needed to expand my knowledge and am now going for full-stack. Although, now I will stick with the generalized term: _software engineer_. Starting in September 2021, I'll be a PT student of Le Wagon Tokyo. This page will document my journey as software engineer trying to find my way in Japan's tech industry.
