## Updates

# The weekly update!

Hey there! This week has been so busy thus far. This is more of a personal life update.

For starters, I began working full-time again. It's not a dev job, but it's a small detour I must take to pay the bills.

Also, there's more interesting news!

I've been hired as a dev part-time at a remote job in Japan. While it's not necessarily anything special, it is a step in the right direction.

With that being said, I got my first true project. Well, it may not anything spectacular, it is something. My project is to take 17 pdf images and recreate them into HTML/CSS files.

# Another shocking update

Well, I won't say this just yet... but there maybe some bigg(er) maybe happening in the next few months! If all goes according to plan, I may become a student of a particular coding bootcamp in September!
