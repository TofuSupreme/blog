# Projects, 100 Days of Coding Challenge and more ~

Hello! How have you been? It's been a while since I've made a post. Within that time, it doesn't appear that I have been busy... but I guess I have?

## Worked on two individual projects

With the help and guidance of my mentor, I was able to complete two additional projects.

### The First Project

Yup! I did another [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) project.

In this particular project, I used vanilla JS/CSS/HTML. The purpose of the project is to create a simple sign-in form. If the user is unable to satisfy certain requirements, there will be prompt telling them to fill in necessary information. Why not [try it out](https://signup-form-chi.vercel.app/) ?

### The Second Project

Well, the second project was actually a coding test. Unfortunately, I am unable to post the content here. Sorry!

## 100 Days of Coding Challenge???

Although I have been coding and practicing almost daily, I wanted to hold myself accountable. This will actually be my 2nd round of the coding challenge. Please check out progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KaiVanilla)

## And more ~ ???

In life news, after much consideration, I will be staying in Japan for a few more years. With that being said, I want to be more marketable in Japan. With that being the case, my mentor and I decided that doing a little bit of Back End may be beneficial. So! Starting next week I am going to learn some Node.js, Express, and more! Little does my mentor know, I will also start making projects using React.

Well, that's it folks. Take care, live life, and enjoy yourselves~
