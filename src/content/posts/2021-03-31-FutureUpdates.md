# Welcome Spring!

It's finally spring! The cherry blossoms are blooming in Japan and the children are enjoying the spring breaks! The college/high school graduates are feverishly searching for employment or are getting ready to embark on their career journeys!

While I won't be joining them this time, I wish them all good luck.

## Current updates

### MERN!? HUH!?

- I have decided aim for a Full Stack developer. Maybe MERN?
- While following the advice of many senior developers, I am going to stick with one language: **Javascript**. At the moment, I am learning Node JS, Mongo DB, Express, and will work on more Back End technologies in the near future.
- I am on Day 17 of my second round of "100 Days of Code". Each day I am either doing readings, or learning little things. I have not actually coded in a few days.
- Job hunting is at a stand still for the time being. I need more projects to show in my portfolio. While I have not stopped, there's no need to push out weak resumes everyday.

### But wait, there's more!

I may have some exciting news in May! I cannot say anything at the moment. But, if things go according to plan, I'll most definitely post it here!
