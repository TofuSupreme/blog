# It's been a long time!

## What have I been up to?

I am still going strong with the **100 Days of Code** challenge. At the moment I am on day 60. I have shifted gears quite a bit since the last update. I have slowed down the breaks on my job hunting journey. I have decided to focus more on my skills and reevaluate my strategy.

My original stretch goal was to just throw out a lot of resumes with a shabby github account and really hope for the best. Of course, that is not how the industry works. The competition is fierce and without real polished projects, employers would not even give me the time of day.

In retrospect, it is a blessing in disguise. I needed to really put things into perspective. The way I was going, I would of had to sacrifice a baby lamb, or conjure up some deal with the Devil to even stand a chance! However, I did get the opportunity to do 2 coding tests/interviews! I did not pass neither one of them, but it was a great learning experience nonetheless.

Since making my decision to become a Full Stack developer, I had to learn more Back End technologies.

At the moment, I am learning Vue, Node.js, implementing APIs, revisiting JavaScript concepts, and more! In addition to that, I have re-enrolled in **The Odin Project**'s Foundations Course. Before I thought I was too above it to complete it, but I'll be damned! I am most certainly not. I severally suffered through an inflated ego thanks to tutorial hell.

Although I have pushed things back a bit, I am still determined to get hired by the end of this year. I know plenty of people who get hired within a month, or some who take approximately 6 months+ to get hired. On the bright side, I have a great mentor and a better focus / vision to succeed.

I have already dreamed my life as a developer and living the developer lifestyle in my head. Now it is about putting things into motion and making it come true!
