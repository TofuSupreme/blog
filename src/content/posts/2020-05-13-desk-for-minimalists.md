I'm not very good at blogs, but still here we go ~

I would like to state the purpose of this blog and a bit about me.


Purpose:
The purpose of this blog is to talk about my journey as a Front End Engineer.
I will talk about my learning process, the small projects I make, the mistakes,
and what I have learned in the process.

In order for this blog to be a bit more personal, I may talk about my personal life
from time-to-time.
