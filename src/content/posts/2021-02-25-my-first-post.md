# It All Starts Somewhere.... #

Welcome to my page and my first post! I am still getting the hang of everything, but why don't I open up with a small introduction and how I got here...

In the words of Deckard Cain
> Stay a while and listen ....


My journey to becoming a Frontend Developer (Engineer) started during the pandemic in March, 2020. Reaching my sixth year in Japan and finishing up another stint with my teaching dispatch company, I was desperately seeking a change. My original goal was to become a translator. However, that did not settle too well with me.

I have tried everything to figure out what was good for me. After a series of *free* personality tests (I'm an ENTJ...), and career aptitude tests, I came across the job title **Web Developer**. Curious about the career, I took advantage Udemy's *reasonably* priced courses and came across Colt Steel's "Web Developer Bootcamp" (before it's overhaul in 2021). Then, the rest was history.

I tried to consume as much as possible. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some. I also participated in the #100DaysCode challenge on Twitter to hold myself accountable. Although I usually try to do things by myself, I've realized that after being dumbfounded by JavaScript, I couldn't do this alone. I needed a mentor to guide me through my journey.

As fate has it, I was able to get in touch with an experienced full stack developer with over 10 years experience. Through his patience, kindness, and extensive knowledge, I have learned so much about becoming a Frontend Developer. 

I have not made my debut into the professional world just yet, but after struggling with coding along with two part-time jobs; I know this is right path for me. I will not kid myself, I have so much more to learn. But, that's the beauty of this field. There's always room for growth and learning! 

If you've made it this far from my ramblings, I humbly thank you so much for reading.
