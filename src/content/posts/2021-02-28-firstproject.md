# First Project 

Greetings everyone! I hope you're doing well.

It has been approximately 9-10 months since my Frontend dev journey. Most of the time; with the help of my mentor, I have created small apps. Some of the technologies I've used were Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, Tailwind CSS, React JS, Bootstrap, and more.

Most of my projects were fairly difficult (for me), but it was very fun to create something and see it come together. There are other projects I'd like to talk about later, this post is about a particular project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

This site is so awesome! The purpose of the website is for devs to practice, polish, and level up their front-end coding skills. The challenges vary from Newbie (the easiest) to Guru (the hardest).

If you're interested, I'd highly suggest you check out their website! Most of the challenges are free, but there are a few behind a pay wall. *No, I am not sponsored, but I really do think this site deserves publicity*

 In any case, I call this my first project because this is the very first project I have submitted for review. 

 ## My thoughts  ##

 * I need more practice with Javascript. I had a bit of trouble with the scripts. Thankfully, my mentor was able to help me out. I need to review vanilla JS.

 * I am slightly more comfortable with CSS. I fought with CSS to get everything aligned correctly. I do not think my code was a standard practice. 

 * Although my project was a 'newbie' level, it felt as if somethings were a bit more advanced. For example, the width of the desktop and mobile mode were given; but not the height. There were a lot of guesswork with the CSS....
 
 

Overall, I had a fun time with this project. I did learn a lot from the project and looking forward to doing more in the near future.
