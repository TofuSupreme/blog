# And here we go ~

Searching for a job during these times is tough. It's a whole new beast if you're doing it in another country. In my case, it is in Japan. But that's not all folks, let's just add a few other attributes:

- Over the age of 30
- Foreigner
- Female
- Worked for one field for over 6 years
- Newbie to Tech

And there you have what's a receipe for a level 50+ challenge. My journey has just started but so far I have applied to over 30 jobs. Only two was gracious enough to give me the rejection notification. I'm unfortunately expecting a bit more to follow.

Japan is notorious for using recruiters as way for employment. I'm not necessarily familiar with this practice. The previous jobs I've had (technically only 4) were direct hires through a job search engine website.

These are new terriorities for me. But, isn't that with any career change?

Today was exceptionally special. I finally received an email from a recruiter I've previously sent my information to. He email was that of a text with no formalities. This _kind_ and _considerate_ recruiter says:

## _Your skills for an engineer position is impossible. Don't you have any interest in teaching children?_

Wow. I was taken aback. I whipped up some response and sent it. Usually, I would feel defeated but...

_But something different happened_

I felt **determination**. I felt like this was a direct challenge for me and I personally accept it. Deep down inside I know what I am doing is the right path for me. With that said, a few crummy responses or ghosting won't deter me.
