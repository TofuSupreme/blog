# Announcements and the direction of this blog

First and foremost, I've completed my second round of #100DaysOfCode! I'm so proud of myself. It's almost second nature to take some time out of my day to study code or work on a project. Although the progress has significantly slowed down since I've started a full-time job, I still try to make it a habit to code at least 15 hours a week.

I'm proud to report that for the past two weeks, I've kept up the momentum.

## Current projects

- **Chat App project**

  - This project is to help me create an application that connects both the front end using Vue and the backend using Node.js. The purpose of this project is to explore using various libaries such as:
    _ express
    _ nodemon
    _ moongose (for connecting the data to a database)
    _ etc...
    At the moment, this project is still a big work in progress. One of the roadblocks I'm facing right now is connecting Vue to the server.js in a seperate file. Additionally, the data was originally hardcoded but then moved to MongoDB. With the guidance of my mentor, I hope to finish the project sometime in July.

- **Remote Job assignment**

  - The purpose of this assignment is to create pdf designs into HTML and CSS with the goal of then converting these files into Vue. (Which is why I'm using Vue in the chat app project). This project has been slightly time consuming, but still a great learning experience! I was also asked to use Sass. Which is something I have not used before. So, onto learning Sass! I hope to finish this project ALSO in July.

  ## Yes, the logo ...

  _Allow_ me to address the elephant in the room. I've successfully applied and have been accepted into Le Wagon Japan's September PT cohort! This was not an easy decision for me. I'm fairly poor and am currently working FT.
  So one might ask _Why do it!? Can't you just self study--blah blah blah_ Yes, I can. And have been for about a year now. However, the self-taught road has not brought me any fruitful results. Along with CoVid and being in Japan, it's not necessarily easy to network as it would have been in the US. On top of that, I really need structured learning. I love learning on my own, but I do need guidance. If not, I'm practically floating all over the place.

  It was a **SERIOUS** battle between Le Wagon and its very popular competitor. Trust me, I've done a lot of research and listed out pros/cons between both of the bootcamps. However, fate seemed it wasn't meant to be. Reasons being: I missed the PT deadline and the next one would be in January 2022 _and_ the price is well out of my price-range. I know their stuff is topnotch, but poor me can't afford it. On top of that, they've recently remote access for their FT courses. So with that being the case, Le Wagon was the next best option.

  ## My further plans for this blog

  Fall posts for this blog will be refocused on my journey as a PT student of Le Wagon Tokyo. I'll try my best to capture my journey as a bootcamp student while working FT in an unrelated field. My _why_ for this is: I want to inspire others who are on a similiar journey. I'm over 30, married to non-Japanese in Japan, no technical background, and have been in the ALT game for longer than anticipated. I want to show others that with hard work, a plan, a bit of luck, and determination, they too can change their lives.
