## Current project

A few weeks ago, my remote job requested that I learn how to use Vue just in case a project were to arise. Even though I wanted to continue working with React, I thought that learning Vue would be interesting and fun. I started out by doing some Vue tutorials on [VueMastery](www.vuemastery.com) The structure of the lectures were simple enough to follow and each lecture was accompanied with a video and written documentation. The code-along videos averaged out to about 5-14 minutes. Although it was easy to follow, some concepts are a bit harder to understand than others. With that being the case, some of the videos went too fast and it left me in the dust! Thankfully the docs were sequenced just like the video, so it was easy for me to find out where I stopped and continue from there.

Alongside of learning Vue, my mentor introduced websockets. Since my goal is to become a Full Stack Dev, I have been learning how to use Node.js, express, and others. After completing a small server-side chat app, my mentor suggested that we work on a full stack project.

Here comes in the chat app.

With my mentor as a guide, I started working on a full stack chat app project. Currently, I have finished the client side portion in Vue. There were many challenges I've faced along the way.

I still struggle with Vue's methods, binding, and passing props from parent to child.

With this project, it did really help make me understand these concepts.

The next part is for me to connect the client side to the server side.
